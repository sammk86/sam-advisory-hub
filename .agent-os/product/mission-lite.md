# Product Mission (Lite)

MentorshipHub is a comprehensive platform that helps Dr. Sam Mokhtari deliver structured mentorship programs and strategic advisory services by providing unified client management, automated scheduling, progress tracking, and integrated payment processing.

MentorshipHub serves both mentees seeking career advancement and advisory clients needing strategic consultation. Unlike generic coaching platforms, we provide specialized workflows that differentiate between ongoing mentorship relationships (with roadmaps and milestones) and project-based advisory engagements (with deliverables and hour tracking), resulting in 60% better client outcome tracking and 50% reduced operational overhead.
